# Caching considerations {#ch-caching}

I didn't want to discuss caching too much, but later I did spread couple of sections about it
throughout the text. Later I decided to concentrate them here and be (mostly) done with it for
the sake of this book.

While persistence context (`EntityManager` or session) is sometimes considered a cache too, it
is merely a part of the unit-of-work pattern ([identity map](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/identityMap.html)).
The real cache sits underneath and is shared on the level of the `EntityManagerFactory` -- or
even between more of them across various JVMs in case of distributed caches. This is called
the *second-level cache*.[^slc] It is used to enhance performance, typically by avoiding
round-trips to the database. But caching has consequences.

[^slc]: Second-level cache is most popular term, used also in [[JPspec](#bib-jpspec)]. It appears
    in [[PJPA2](#bib-projpa2)] too, but *in-memory cache* is used more often there.


## Caching control

[[JPspec](#bib-jpspec)] doesn't say much about caching. It says how to configure it -- starting
with `shared-cache-mode` in your `persistence.xml`. But I'd probably study caching documentation
of a particular provider, because if you don't care at all, you don't even know whether and how
you use the cache.

Without choosing `shared-cache-mode` it is up to the JPA provider and its defaults. This may render
any use of `@Cacheable` annotations useless. Currently, Hibernate typically doesn't cache by
default, while EclipseLink caches everything by default. Being oblivious to the cache (not related
to *cache-oblivious algorithms* at all) is rather dangerous, especially if your application is
not the only one running against the same database. In that case setting `shared-cache-mode`
explicitly to `NONE` is by far the best start. You may revisit your decisions later, but at least
you know what is happening.

T> ### Database caches too
T>
T> Caching happens also directly on the database level. You still incur a network round-trip but it
T> does not necessarily load data from a disk (that would be really slow) and you don't have this
T> entity-query duality -- although we don't know how complex the database cache is. In any case,
T> it is used whether we use second-level cache or not and, luckily, it is mostly totally
T> transparent for a programmer or user.
T>
T> If you don't want to dig deep you may disable ORM caches knowing that something still probably
T> caches for you. Often you can see that the first request for a page of something is slow
T> but the second requests is much faster -- even if both go to the database. Sure you don't go
T> as fast as you can, but you avoided a lot of problems, like stale data on the screen when you
T> change them in the database directly or distributed caches when you scale your application
T> while still using a single database server (until sufficient).

Probably the most important question to consider is: Is your application the sole user of
a particular database? Is it running in a single process? If yes, you may safely use the cache. But
I'd not "just use the defaults" of the JPA provider -- which may be no cache as well. It's
not a good idea to use caching without any thought at all. I prefer not to use it until I feel the
need. When you start using the cache and tuning it be prepared for a walk that may be not as easy
as it seems.

Entity cache returning you entities by ID really quickly sounds like a good idea because
it makes the problem of eager-loads of *to-one* relationships less serious. E.g. when we load a dog
we may get its breed quickly from the cache. It doesn't fix the problem though as all the
additional entities are part of your current persistence context whether you want them or not.
E.g. we want to update a single attribute of a dog and we are not interested in its breed. We
already mentioned that units of work bigger than necessary are not for free.

T> ### When JPA is not the only one caching
T>
T> Imagine you're caching returned JPA entities with *JSR 107*, e.g. using Spring implementation of
T> the JSR. It can be some data access method that returns single entity for a filter -- filter
T> is the key to the cache. There is one serious problem with this approach. Let's ignore that
T> we may have many keys that return the same entity, but in the cache these may be stored as
T> many instances (I'm not sure, but I doubt that identity is considered to de-duplicate values).
T> The real problem is that when the cache misses it reaches for JPA to get the entity, stores
T> it and gives it to you -- attached. But when the cache hits it returns detached entity. This
T> is highly non-deterministic situation that may lead to exceptions in better case or to
T> unexpected changes of entities in worse one, depending on the code that uses such a method.
T>
T> All in all -- don't cache managed stuff with technology that doesn't understand it.


## Second-level cache vs queries {#cache-vs-queries}

Caching should be transparent, but just turning it on is a kind of *premature optimization* which
-- in virtually all cases -- ends up being wrong. Any auto-magic can only go so far, and any
caching leads to potential inconsistencies. I believe most JPA users don't understand how the cache
is structured (I'm talking from my own experience too, after all). This depends on a concrete ORM,
but typically there is an *entity cache* and a *query cache*.

Entity cache helps with performance of `EntityManager.find`, or generally with loading by entity's
`@Id` attribute. But this will not help you if you accidentally obfuscate what you want with a
query, that would otherwise return the same. The provider has no way to know what entity (with what
ID) will be loaded just looking at arbitrary where conditions. This is what query cache is for.
Bulk update and deletes using JPQL go around either of these caches and the safest way how to
avoid inconsistent data is to evict all entities of the modified type from the caches. This is
often performed by the ORM provider automatically (again, check documentation and settings).

D> Vlad Mihalcea, author of the recent Leanpub book [High-Performance Java
D> Persistence](https://leanpub.com/high-performance-java-persistence) [[HPJP](#bib-hpjp)],
D> does not recommend to rely on query cache primarily before tuning other aspects like pooling,
D> how many rows and columns we fetch, etc. In update-heave applications query cache can actually
D> worse the overall performance. For more, see also his presentation [High-performance
D> JDBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u25Xc88d_iE).

If you only work with whole entities all the time *and* nothing else accesses the database you
can be pretty sure you always get the right result from the entity cache. You may wonder how this
cache behaves in concurrent environment (like any EE/Spring application inherently is). If you
imagine it as a `Map`, even with synchronized access, you may feel the horror of getting the same
entity instance (`Dog` with the same ID) for two concurrent persistence contexts (like concurrent
HTTP requests) that subsequently modify various fields on the shared instance. Luckily, ORMs
provide each thread with its own copy of the entity. Internally they typically keep entities in
the cache in some "dehydrated" form.[^ecacheorm]

## Explicit application-level cache

Previously we ignored the case when we cache some entities under multiple different keys, not
necessarily retrieved by the same method. Imagine a component that returns some classifiers
by various attributes (ID, name, code, whatnot) -- this is pretty realistic scenario. You code
it as a managed component with declarative cache. There are separate methods to obtain the
classifier by specific attributes. If you retrieve the same classifier by three different
attributes you'll populate three different caches with -- essentially the same -- entity stored
under different key (attribute value) in each of these caches.

Even if we ignore that the entities sometimes participate in the persistence context and
sometimes don't this consumes more memory space than necessary. It may still be acceptable though.
Personally I believe that the non-determinism regarding the attached/detached state is more serious
but let's say these are only for reading and we may not care. Imagine further that we may filter
on these entities -- like "give me a list of classifiers with name starting with BA". Now we have
even more variability in cache keys -- any distinct filter is the key -- and probably many more
repeated entities in the results. But these are likely distinct objects even for the same
logical entities. This may either explode your cache, or cause frequent evictions rendering your
cache useless, probably utilizing more CPU in the process.

If the amount of underlying data is big we may have no other chance, but in case of various
administered static data, code books or classifiers the size of the table is typically small.
Once our DB admins reported that we queried a table with 20k rows of static data 20 million times
a day -- not to mention the traffic on our site was in order of thousands of request a day. It was
an unnecessarily rich relational model and this part of system would be better represented in some
kind of document/NoSQL store. We didn't use the relations in that data that much -- and they
actually prevented some needed data fixes because of overly restricted cobweb of foreign keys.
But this was the design we had and we needed a fix. "Can't you just cache it somehow?" The data
were localization keys -- not for the application itself but for some form templates -- so it was
part of the data model. We joined these keys based on the user's language for each row of possibly
multi-row template (often with hundreds of rows).

First we needed to drop the joins. Plan was to ask some cache component for any of these
localization keys based on its ID and the language. It took us some time to rewrite all the code
that could utilize it and originally just joined the data in queries. But the result was worth
it. The component simply read the whole table and created map of maps based on the languages and
IDs. DB guys were happy. We stopped executing some queries altogether and removed unnecessary
joins from many others.

There are other situations when you may seriously consider just coding your own cache explicitly
and not rely on declarative one like *JSR 107*. Declarative cache doesn't mean *unattended* anyway.
You should limit it, set policies, etc. It can be extremely handy when you can get results cheap
and this typically happens when limited subset of possibly big chunk of data is used repeatedly
using the same keys.

Programmatic (explicit) cache can shine in other areas:

* When you work with limited set of data and you need it often -- and you want to pre-cache it.
This may be reasonable scenario also for declarative cache if you can pre-fill it somehow and
there is a single way how you obtain the data.
* If you require the same data based on various attributes (different views). You can use
multiple maps that point to the same actual instances. This can work both for cases when you
cache as you go (when misses are possible) and when you preload the whole set (ideal case when
not too big).
* The cache can cooperate with any administrative features that modify the underlying data.
Because we code it with full knowledge of the logic behind the data we can selectively refresh
update the cache in a smart way. In declarative cache you often have to evict it completely --
although this can still be good simple strategy even for programmatic caches, especially
when the refresh requires a single select.
* Full preload requires more memory up-front and slows down the startup of the application (can
be done lazily on-demand) but deals with the DB once and for all. Declarative cache executes
a query on demand for every miss but loads only some of the data that require caching --
potentially less efficiently than full preload.

Of course, there are cases when we can't use fully pre-loaded cache. In general, ask yourself
a question whether "cache this by this key" is best (or good enough) solution or whether you can
implement a component utilizing logic behind the data better -- and whether it's all worth it.


## Conclusion

You should be very aware of your cache setup. You should be very clear how you want to do it.
In the code it may look automagical, but it must be explicit somewhere -- your strategy must be
well known to all the people who may encounter it in any way (even without knowing).

You always trade something for something -- with caching it's typically memory for speed. Memory
can slow you down too, but in general we have plenty of it nowadays. While you are in a single
process a JPA provider can typically manage the data consistency. If you have a distributed
architecture you enter a different world altogether and I'd think twice before going there. You
must feel the need for it and you must measure what you got -- because you'll definitely get
complexity and you have to think about consistency much more.

Don't mix freely caching on multiple levels. Database cache is mostly transparent to us, but
when you mix two declarative caches you often make matters worse. Especially when you cache
entities with technology that is not aware of their lifecycle within the persistence context.

Finally, depending on what your keys for caching are you may waste a lot of memory. Entity ID
(like in second level cache) is natural and good key. But if you key on many various selectors that
may return the same entities (single or even whole collections) you may store many instances for
the same entity in the cache. That wastes memory. Knowing more about the logic between the keys
and values you may get better results with your implementation of some explicit cache on
an application level. It may require more effort but the pay-off may be significant.
