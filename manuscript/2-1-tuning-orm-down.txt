# Tuning ORM down {#ch-tuning-orm-down}

Full-blown object-relational mapping maps database foreign keys as relations between objects.
Instead of `Integer breedId` you have `Breed breed` where mapping information provides all the
necessary low-level information about the foreign key. This mapping information can be stored
elsewhere (typically XML mapping file) or as annotations directly on the entity (probably more
popular nowadays). Relations can be mapped in any direction, even in reverse, for one or both
directions and in any cardinality with annotations `@OneOnOne`, `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`
and `@ManyToMany`. If you map both directions you choose the owner's side, which is kinda more
"in control" of the relationship. Mapping foreign keys as relations is probably the most
pronounced feature of ORM -- and originally I wanted to make a case against it in this very book.

In an ironic twist I discovered that the way we bent *JPA 2.1* works only on its reference
implementation, that is EclipseLink, this all more than a year too late. I was considering to
stop any further work on the book after loosing this most important showcase point. After all
I decided to go on with a weaker version after all. We will describe the troubles with *to-one*
relations, their possible solutions -- including the one that is not JPA-compliant -- and there
are also other helpful tips, many Querydsl examples throughout and two Querydsl dedicated chapters.

Most of the points I'm going to explain somehow revolve around two rules:

* **Be explicit.** For instance don't leave persistence context (session) open after you leave
the service layer and don't wait for the presentation layer to load something lazily. Make explicit
contract and fetch eagerly what you need for presentation, just like you would with plain SQL
(but still avoiding ORM syndrome "load the whole DB"). Also, don't rely on caches blindly.
* **Don't go lazy.** Or at least not easily. This obviously stems from the previous point, but
goes further. Lazy may save some queries here and there, but in practice we rely on it too much.
In most cases we can be explicit, but we're lazy to be so (so let's not go lazy ourselves either).
There are places where `FetchType.LAZY` means nothing to JPA. Oh, they will say it's a hint for
a provider, but it's not guaranteed. That's nothing for me. Let's face it -- any *to-one* mapping
is eager, unless you add some complexity to your system to make it lazy. It's not lazy because you
annotate it so, deal with it.

As a kind of shortcut I have to mention that Hibernate 5.x supports `LAZY` *to-one* relationships
as you'd expect, more about it later in part on how [lazy is (not) guaranteed](#lazy-not-guaranteed).
When talking about often vain `LAZY` on *to-one*, let me be clear that it is still preferred
fetching for collections -- and quite reliable for them as well. This does not mean you should
rely on these lazy *to-many* relations when you want to fetch them for multiple entities at once.
For instance if you want to display a page with the list of messages with attachments, possibly
multiple of them for each message, you should not wait for lazy fetch. More about this in the
chapter [Avoid N+1 select](#ch-avoid-n-plus-1).


## Price for relations

For me the biggest problem is that JPA does not provide any convenient way how to stop cascading
loads for `@ManyToOne` and `@OneToOne` (commonly named *to-one* in this book as you probably
noticed) relationships. I don't mind *to-many* relations, they have their twists, but at least
their lazy works. But *to-one* typically triggers find by id. If you have a `Dog` that has an
`owner` (type `Person`) and is of specific `Breed` you must load these two things along with a dog.
Maybe they will be joined by the JPA provider (Hibernate does it), maybe not (EclipseLink), maybe
they are already in second-level cache and will be "loaded" nearly "for free". All these options
should be seriously considered, analyzed and proved before you can say that you know what is going
on in your application.

And it just starts there, because `Person` has an `Address` which -- in case of a rich system --
may further point to `District`, `County`, `State` and so on. Once I wanted to change something
like `Currency` in a treasury system. It loaded around 50 objects -- all of them across these
*to-one* relations. This may happen when you naively want to change a single attribute in that
currency. In SQL terms, that's an update of a single column for a single row.

When you insert or update a `Dog` you can use `em.getReference(clazz, id)` to get a `Breed` object
containing only id of the breed. This effectively works as a wrapped foreign key (FK). Heck, you
can just `new` an empty `Breed` and set its id, you don't even have to ask `em` for the reference.
In case of update you will not save much as that `Dog` is probably managed already anyway. You
can either update managed entity -- which means it loaded previous values for all *to-one* FKs
cascading as far as it needed -- or you can try to *merge* the entity -- but this works only if
you overwrite it completely, it's not usable for update of a single column. Or should you just use
JPQL update and possibly remove all dogs from the second-level cache? How ORM is that?

Why JPA doesn't provide better fetch control for finds? I want to work with this `Dog` object now,
I'm not interested in its relations, just wrap those FK values into otherwise empty entity objects
(like references) and let me do my stuff! How I wished I could just map raw FK value instead of
relation... actually, you can, but while you are able to load such related object explicitly
(find by id), you can't join on that relationship.

If you use EclipseLink you can do it, but that means you can't switch to other JPA 2.1 providers
reliably, not to mention that dropping the mapping is by no means a minor detour from standard
path. However the problems with *to-one* ultimately led me to these extreme measures and I got rid
of *to-one* mappings and never looked back. Because I based my work on reference implementation of
JPA 2.1 (EclipseLink) it took me more than a year to discover I diverged from the standard -- and
even then only because I started to write tests for this book with both major JPA providers.

More about this in the chapter [Troubles with *to-one* relationships](#ch-to-one-troubles).
Other points are much less radical compared to this one. Long before I learnt that being
explicit and less lazy is definitely better and we will talk about it in other sections.


## How does this affect my domain model? {#how-ddd}

I stated that this book will not be about architecture, but this is the part where we have to
tackle it a bit. If we talk about [domain model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_model), we
probably also talk about [domain driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)
(DDD) best described in [[DDD](#bib-ddd)]. I can't claim experience with DDD because I never saw it
in practice, but it must work for some, reportedly, especially for complex business domains with
lots of rules, etc. Reading [[PoEAA](#bib-poeaa)] it is obvious that there's a lot of synergy
between DDD and ORM. One may even ask whether to use ORM without DDD at all. And I can't answer
that, sorry.

[[PoEAA](#bib-poeaa)] recommends other patterns for simpler domain problems (*Transaction Script*,
*Table Module*) with related data source patterns (*Table Data Gateway*, *Row Data Gateway*
or *Active Mapper*). There are some newer architectural solutions as well, like *Command Query
Responsibility Segregation* ([CQRS](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html)) or *Data, context
and interaction* ([DCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data,_context_and_interaction)), both of them
usable with object-oriented languages, but not necessarily for every problem.

Back to domain, though. One anti-pattern often mentioned in relation to ORM/JPA is called
[Anemic domain model](http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html). Let's quote
master Martin Fowler a bit again:

{icon=quote-right}
G> In essence the problem with anemic domain models is that they incur all of the costs of a domain
G> model, without yielding any of the benefits. The primary cost is the awkwardness of mapping to
G> a database, which typically results in a whole layer of O/R mapping. This is worthwhile iff you
G> use the powerful OO techniques to organize complex logic. By pulling all the behavior out into
G> services, however, you essentially end up with Transaction Scripts, and thus lose the advantages
G> that the domain model can bring. As I discussed in P of EAA, Domain Models aren't always the
G> best tool.

I'm not able to slip out of this topic and make object purists happy, but there are many other
styles of programming and the question (far beyond the scope of this book) is whether being purely
OO is the most important thing after all. In most projects I treated my entities like java beans
with just a little low-level logic to it -- so it was mostly this "anemic domain model" song. But
entity objects can be perfect [data transfer objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object)
(DTOs) in many situations. It is still far more advanced compared to amorphous rows of a
`ResultSet`. We have dumb model, but we can utilize it in a domain if we need to.

I even contemplated something like "domain over entity model" solution where entity is as dumb
as possible (it still has responsibility for me, it maps to a database table) and I can wrap it
with whatever logic I want in a domain object. This even allows me to reverse some dependencies
if I wish so -- for instance, in a database my order items point to the order using a foreign key,
but in my higher model it can be the other way around, invoice can aggregate items that may not
even know about an order.

In any case, whatever we do, we can hardly get rid of all the notions of a particular data store
we use, because any such "total abstraction" must lead to some mismatch -- and that typically
leads to complexity and often significant performance penalty as well. The way I go with this
book is trying to get as much benefit from using the JPA without incurring too much cost. Maybe
I'm not going for the best approach, but I'm trying to avoid the biggest pain points while
accepting that I have SQL somewhere down there.

One thing I respect on Fowler et al. is that they try to balance costs/benefits and they neither
push ORM always forward nor do they criticize it all the time without offering real alternatives
for the complex cases. However, many other smart and experienced people dislike ORM. Listening to
"pure haters" does not bring much to a discussion, but some cases are well-argued, offering options
and you can sense the deep understanding of the topic.


## When to tune down and when not?

I'd say: "Just use it out of the box until it works for you." There are good reasons not to rely
on something we don't understand but in custom enterprise software there often is no other way.
For many systems everything will be OK, but for slightly complicated database/domain models
a lot of things can go wrong.


### Performance problems

Most typically the performance degrades first. You definitely should start looking at the generated
queries. Something can be fixed in the database (typically with indexes), some queries can be
rewritten in the application but sometimes you have to adjust the mapping.

With *to-one* relations you either have ORM with reliable lazy fetch or you have to do tricks
described in [Troubles with *to-one* relationships](#ch-to-one-troubles) or even change the mapping
in a way that is not JPA compliant, as in [Removing *to-one* altogether](#ch-without-to-one).
There are also still JPA native queries and JDBC underneath -- needless to say that all of this
introduces new concept into the code and if we mix it too much the complexity is on the rise.

*To-many* has less problems but some mappers generate more SQL joins than necessary. This can be
often mended by introducing explicit entity mapping for the associative table. This does not raise
conceptual complexity but some query code may look awkward and more SQL like instead of JPA like.
I argue that explicit joins are not that bad though.

Other typical problems involve N+1 select problem, but this type of problems is easy to avoid if
we are explicit with our service contracts and don't let presentation layer to initiate lazy load.


### Strange persistence bugs

Most typical enterprise applications can keep persistence context short -- and we should. When
ORM got mainstream a lot of people complained about lazy load exceptions (like the Hibernate famous
`LazyInitializationException`) but this results from misusing ORM. Programmers solved it with
making the session (persistence context) longer and introduced *Open Session In View* (OSIV)
pattern. This is now widely considered anti-pattern and there are many good reasons for that.

Using OSIV allowed to keep "back-end" and "front-end" programmers separated, dealing only with some
common service API, but this API was leaky when it didn't load all the data and let presentation
fetch the rest on demand. Instead of making it explicit what data the service call provides for the
view we let the view[^serviceview] to perform virtually anything on the managed ("live") entities.
This means that the presentation programmers must be very careful what they do.

[^serviceview]: View from the perspective of a service layer, it could be model in MVC at the
    presentation layer. We can also talk about client of the service layer but client may be just
    as confusing out of context.
