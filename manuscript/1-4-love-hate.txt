# Love and hate for ORM {#ch-love-hate}

As I said already, ORM is typically seen as a good fit with domain-driven design (DDD). But
ORM happened to become extremely popular and people thought it will solve all their database
access problems without the need to learn SQL. This way obviously failed and hurt ORM back a lot,
too. I say it again, ORM is very difficult, even using well documented ORM (like the JPA standard)
is hard -- there's simply too much in it. We're dealing with complex problem, with a mismatch --
and some kind of mismatch it is. And it's not the basic principle that hurts, we always get burnt
on many, too many, details.


## Vietnam of Computer Science {#vietnam}

One of the best balanced texts that critique ORM, and probably one of the most famous, is quite
old actually. In 2006 Ted Neward wrote an extensive post with a fitting, if provoking, name
[The Vietnam of Computer Science](http://blogs.tedneward.com/post/the-vietnam-of-computer-science/).
If you seriously want to use ORM on any of your projects, you should read this -- unless data
access is not an important part of that project (who are we kidding, right?). You may skip the
history of Vietnam war, but definitely give the technical part a dive it deserves.

ORM wasn't that young anymore in 2006 and various experiences had shown that it easily brought more
problems than benefits -- especially if approached with partial knowledge, typically based on
an assumption that "our developers don't need to know SQL". When some kind of non-programming
architect recommends this for a project and they are long gone when the first troubles appear it's
really easy to recommend it again. It was so easy to generate entities from our
[DDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language),
wasn't it? Hopefully managers are too high to be an audience for JPA/ORM recommendations,
but technical guys can hurt themselves well enough. The JPA, for instance, is still shiny, it's a
standard after all -- and yeah, it is kinda Java EE-ish, but this is the good new EE, right?

Wrong. Firstly, JPA/ORM is so complex when it comes to details, that using it as a tool for "cheap
developers" who don't need to learn SQL is as silly as it gets. I don't know when learning became
the bad thing in the first place, but some managers think they can save man-months/time/money
without learning. When the things get messy -- and they will -- there is nobody around who really
understands ORM and there is virtually no chance to rewrite data access layer to get rid of it.
Easiest thing to do is to blame ORM.

You may ask: What has changed since 2006? My personal take on the answer would be:

* Nothing essential could have changed, we merely smoothed some rough edges, got a bit more
familiar with already familiar topic and in Java space we standardized the beast (JPA).
* We added more options to query languages to make the gap with SQL smaller. Funny enough, the JPA
actually didn't help here as it lagged couple of years behind capabilities of the leading ORM
solutions.
* Query-by-API (mentioned in the post) is much better nowadays, state of the art technologies like
Querydsl have very rich fluent API that is also very compact (definitely not "much more verbose
than the traditional SQL approach"). Also both type safety and testing practices are much more
developed.

Other than that, virtually all the concerns Ted mentioned are still valid.


## Not much love for ORM

Whatever was written back in 2006, ORMs were on the rise since then. Maybe the absolute numbers of
ORM experts are now higher than then, but I'd bet the ratio of experts among its users plummeted
(though I have no research to support this). ORM/JPA is easily available, Java EE supports it,
Spring supports it, you can use it in Java SE easily, you can even generate CRUD scaffolding for
your application with JPA using some [rapid application development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development)
tools. That means a lot of developers are exposed to it. In many cases it seems deceivingly easy
when you start using it.

ORM has a bad reputation with our [DBAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_administrator) --
and for good reasons too. It takes some effort to make it use reasonable queries, not to mention
that you typically have to break the ORM abstraction to do so. It's good to start with clean,
untangled code as it helps tremendously when you need to optimize some queries later. This,
however, causes many complications. If you explicitly name columns and don't load whole entities
you may get better performance, but it will be unfriendly to the entity cache. The same goes for
bulk updates (e.g. "change this column for all entities where..."). There are the right ways to
do it in the domain model, but learning the right path of OO and domain-driven design is probably
even harder than starting with JPA -- otherwise we'd see many more DDD-based projects around.

We will tackle caching later in this chapter, but I'd say that misunderstandings around ORM caching
are the reason for a lot of performance problems and potentially for data corruption too. This is
when it starts to hurt -- and when you can't get easily out, hate often comes with it. When you
make a mistake with a UI library, you may convince someone to let you rewrite it -- and they can
see the difference. Rewriting data access layer gives seemingly nothing to the client, unless the
data access is really slow, but then the damage done is already quite big anyway.


## But a lot of hate

When you need to bash some technology, ORM is a safe bet. I don't know whether I should even
mention [ORM Is an Offensive Anti-Pattern](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/12/01/orm-offensive-anti-pattern.html)
but as it is now the top result on Google search for ORM, I do it anyway. It wouldn't be fair to
say the author doesn't provide an alternative, but I had read a lot of his other posts (before I
stopped) to see where "SQL-speaking objects" are going to. I cannot see
[single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)
in it at all, and while SRP doesn't have to be the single holy grail of OOP, putting everything
into the domain object itself is not a good idea. In different post, domain objects were "enriched"
with all kinds of serialization needed, effectively binding possibly all domain objects to possibly
all technologies you need. I believe OOP has been there already, maybe not before I was born, but
definitely long before I started programming.

There are other flaws with this particular post. Mapping is explained on a very primitive case,
while ORM utilizes unit-of-work for cases where you want to execute multiple updates in a single
transaction, possibly updates on the same object. If every elementary change on the object emits
an SQL and we want to set many properties for the same underlying table in a transaction we get
performance even worse than non-tuned ORM! You can answer with object exposing various methods
to update this and that, which possibly leads to a
[combinatorial explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_explosion). Further, in times
of injection we are shown the most verbose way how to do ORM, the way I haven't seen for years.

"SQL-speaking objects" bring us to a more generic topic of modelling objects in our programs. We
hardly model real-life objects as they act in real life, because in many cases we should not.
Information systems allow changing data about things that normally cannot change, because someone
might have entered the information incorrectly in the first place.

How to model the behavior of a tin can? Should it have `open` method? Even in real life *someone*
opens the *tin* with a *tin opener* -- an interaction of three objects. Why do we insist on objects
storing themselves then? It still may be perfectly valid pattern -- as I said real life is not
always a good answer to our modelling needs -- but it is often overused. While in real-life human
does it, we often have various *helper* objects for behavior, often ending with *-er*. While I see
why this is considered anti-pattern, I personally hate rules like *objects (classes) ending with
-er are evil* -- even more than ORM. (They let me think, though.)

In any case I agree with the point that we should not avoid SQL. If we use ORM we should also know
its QL (JPQL for JPA) and how it maps to SQL. We generally should not avoid of what happens down
the stack, especially when the abstraction is not perfect. ORM, no question about it, is not
a perfect abstraction.

To see a much better case against ORM let's read
[ORM is an anti-pattern](http://seldo.com/weblog/2011/08/11/orm_is_an_antipattern). Here we can
find summary of all the bad things related to ORM, there is hardly anything we can argue about
and if you read Ted Neward's post too, you can easily map the problems from one post to another.
We will go the full circle back to Martin Fowler and his
[ORM Hate](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/OrmHate.html). We simply have to accept ORM as it is
and either avoid it, or use it with its limitations, knowing that the abstraction is not perfect.
If we avoid it, we have to choose relational or object world, but we can hardly have both.

There are, of course, many other problems even if we embrace ORM as it is, after all I named many
in chapter [Questionable parts](#ch-questionable-parts).


## Is tuning-down a way out?

Using less of ORM and relying less on complex auto-magic features is a way I propose. It builds
on the premise that we should use ORM where it helps us, avoid it where it does not and know the
consequences of both styles and their interactions. It may happen that using both ways adds
complexity too, but from my experience it is not the case and not inherent problem. JPA has much
better mapping of values from DB to objects compared to the JDBC, so even if you used your entities
as dummy DTOs it is still worth it. It abstracts concrete SQL flavour away which has its benefits
-- and unless this is a real issue for more than couple of queries you can resolve the rest with
either native SQL support in the JPA, or use JDBC based solution.

Coming to relations, there may be many of them where *to-one* does not pose a problem. In that
case make your life easier and use mapping to objects. If cascade loading of *to-one* causes
problems you can try how well is `LAZY` supported by your ORM. Otherwise you have to live with it
for non-critical cases and work around it for the critical ones with queries -- we will get to this
in the chapter [Troubles with *to-one* relationships](#ch-to-one-troubles).

If your ORM allows it, you may go even lower on the abstraction scale and map raw foreign key
values instead of related objects. While the mapping part is possible with the JPA standard, it is
not enough as JPA does not allow you to join on such relationships. EclipseLink offers the last
missing ingredient and this solution is described in the chapter
[Removing *to-one* altogether](#ch-without-to-one).

This all renders ORM as a bit lower-level tool than intended, but still extremely useful. It still
allows you to generate schema from objects if you have control over your RDBMS (sometimes you
don't) or even just document your database with class diagram of entities[^cdd]. We still have to
keep unit-of-work and caching in check, but both are very useful if used well. I definitely don't
avoid using `EntityManager`, how could I? Caching is a different beast though, and deserves its
own section.

[^cdd]: While class diagram does not say exactly the same like E-R diagram I used it successfully
    to communicate design of tables to my DBA who had absolutely no problem to understand it, even
    for cases where many-to-many associative table was implied by a named line. E-R diagram was
    much easier to generate ex-post for documentation purposes.


## And there is more

This list of potential surprises is far from complete, but for the rest of the book we will narrow
our focus to relationships. We will review their mapping and how it affects querying.

I'd like to mention one more problem, kind of natural outcome of real-life software development.
JPA is implemented by couple of projects and these projects have bugs. If the bug is generally
critical, they fix it quite soon. If it's critical only for your project, they may not. Most
ORM projects are now open-sourced and you may try to fix it yourselves, although managing patches
for updated OSS project is rather painful.

It's all about how serious your trouble is -- if you can find work-around, do it. When EclipseLink
returned [empty `stream()`](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=433075) for lazy lists
(because officially they didn't support Java 8, but unofficially they had broken `Vector` subclass)
we simply copied the list and called `stream()` on the copy and we had utility for it. Sure it
wasn't nice, but it worked and it was very easy to remove later. When they fixed the issue we
simplified the code in the utility method and then inlined all the occurrences and it looked like
it never happened.

You may thing about switching your provider -- and JPA 2.1 brought a lot of goodies to make it
even easier as many properties in `persistence.xml` are now non-proprietary. But you still have
to go through the configuration (focus on caching especially) to make it work "as before" and then
you may get caught into *bug cross-fire*, as I call it. I used Hibernate for many years when I
joined another project using EclipseLink. After a few months we wanted to switch to Hibernate as
we discovered that most of the team was more familiar with it. But some of our JPA queries didn't
work on Hibernate because of a [bug](https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-9711).

So even something that should work in theory may be [quite a horror](http://wp.me/pcxwh-bT) in
practice. Hope you have tests to catch any potential bug affecting your project.
