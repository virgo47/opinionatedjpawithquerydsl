-# Preface

This book is about my experience with [object-relational mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)
in general and the [Java Persistence API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API) (JPA)
in particular. It's also about [Querydsl](http://www.querydsl.com/), because since I was
recommended this library I completely fell in love with it. It never let me down and sometimes
generated feeling of sheer happiness -- which is not that common in our programming profession.

Be warned -- this book is, as the title suggests, very opinionated. Sometimes you may ask:
"Why the hell this guy still uses JPA?!" It is not a typical tutorial book covering the technology
systematically -- I cherry-pick instead. It's not a typical best practices book either. We use ORM
technology but not quite as intended. We even left the safe water of JPA specification -- although
originally unintentionally because reference implementation let us.

We decided to take control over the [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) statements our
system produces. You can't rely much on lazy or eager fetch types, because often (as the
specification says) these are mere hints, not real promises. Even with rather SQL-like approach
JPA still provides big benefits over plain
[JDBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity). We tuned down the ORM part of
the JPA a little bit and mapped our entities to resemble "raw" tables more. You may feel like
shouting "that's all wrong!" -- which is OK. Let me answer the following question first...


## Is this book for you?

This book is for anyone who actively uses JPA -- preferably in version 2.1 (*Java EE 7*) --
and is not completely happy with it. It's main focuses is on painful points related to relationship
mapping where benefits mix with unavoidable drawbacks. Even if you're happy with JPA as it is, the
book still can give you more options how to solve your problems.

Some of the considerations are related to ORM in general and may be applicable for non-JPA ORM
providers, but I can't guarantee that. Some parts of the book are more generic and based on common
sense (like "avoid N+1 select"), others are strictly JPA related (like how to achieve modularity).
Some are probably complete answers, recipes even, others are open topics that only raise further
questions. Some are definitely a bit unorthodox from a typical JPA perspective.

Last, but not least, I'll use Querydsl throughout the book -- and this library is still not covered
in books as much as it deserves, I believe.


## Not in the book

This is not an introductory book about JPA, see the next section about other JPA related books.
I expect you know ORM and JPA at least superficially, you work with it for whatever reason (or
will, or want to) and you are interested in something beyond reference material. It does not mean
it is a difficult book though, as I always try explain the problem I talk about.

This is not a book about architecture, at least not primarily, although patterns how to use
JPA are somewhere in the area. I take kind of "Fowlerish" liberty of mixing design and architecture
and blur the line between them. I admit I have not yet worked on such a project where thinking
architecturally big would pay off. Instead I have seen architecture on other projects where the
effort was wasted for various reasons. Some of them are easy to guess if you're interested in an
agile or lean software development. That said, I'll talk about some design considerations,
for instance about the contract between presentation and session layer.

This book does not cover any of these topics:

* JPA support for native SQL -- I don't use it massively and I have nothing much to say about it.
* Calling stored procedures -- it works as expected.
* Criteria API -- because I prefer Querydsl instead.
* Locking, concurrency, validation, transactions and other features not affected by
the *opinionated* approach.
* High performance -- we mention performance, and the advices should not affect it negatively,
but I don't focus on high-performance tricks in particular.

We may mention some of them here and there, but there will be little focus on these. Most of them
are covered elsewhere anyway. Let's talk about some of the books available in this segment.


## Other JPA books

JPA came with EJB 3, actually first as a part of *JSR 220* "Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0", but it soon
proved as a worthy API on its own because it is not tied to EJP in particular. In those days I'd
recommend [Pro EJB 3: Java Persistence API](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1590596455), but I think the
book is now dead (and yes, in 2016 it celebrates its 10^th^ anniversary).

I can highly recommend [Pro JPA 2](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1430249269)
in its 2^nd^ Edition [[PJPA2](#bib-projpa2)],
which is updated to *JPA 2.1* (in line with *Java EE 7*). There is hardly anything I haven't found
in this one. Sure, it's closing to 500 pages, but it's structured well. It has minimal overlap with
the rest of Java EE in *Chapter 3: Enterprise Applications*, but even that may be useful. This
is currently my go-to book when I need to refresh some JPA knowledge.

Then there is [Spring Data](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1449323952) book [[SData](#bib-sdata)].
For the sake of confusion there are actually two books of this name -- one published by O'Reilly
and the other one by Packt, both published within a month late in 2012. If you are Spring positive,
I can only recommend reading at least first 50 pages of the one by O'Reilly (up to chapter 4
including), even if you don't use Spring Data after all. It's a nice quick overview of JPA and
Querydsl with examples of Spring configuration both in XML and Java and they even mention
kind of advanced things like `orphanRemoval` (although rather in passing). It's definitely a little
time well spent anyway.

I don't know any other relevant books, but there is one more obvious resource -- [Java Persistence
2.1 Specification](http://download.oracle.com/otndocs/jcp/persistence-2_1-fr-spec/index.html)
itself [[JPspec](#bib-jpspec)].
There are things you hardly find anywhere else, especially when it comes to corner cases
like *"use of DISTINCT with COUNT is not supported for arguments of embeddable types"*. So when you
encounter a problem it is good to search through the specification for keywords. Often JPA
provider works as specified, even when it does not make sense to us.

There are tons of blog posts, of course, some of them are very influential. I will mention the
most important ones in chapter [Love and hate for ORM](#ch-love-hate).


## Looking back to *Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture*

Martin Fowler wrote his *Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture* [[PoEAA](#bib-poeaa)]
in 2002 trying to capture various patterns that were reoccurring in enterprise applications,
not necessarily written in Java. Many patterns in the book cover data access layer and many of
those are clearly ORM related -- starting with *Data Mapper* going through *Unit of Work*
or *Lazy Load* to many more related to concrete mapping problems.

Reading the material so old also gives you the idea how well the patterns stand the test of time.
In 2002 Java was 7 years old, now it's over 20. There were no annotations and dependency injection
was known in theory, but there was no wide-spread container supporting it (mind you, Spring 1.0 was
released in 2004). Years later we still used various `SessionHelper` static classes to work with
Hibernate `Session` in thread-local manner, often forgetting to close session because we were not
able to clearly put open and close to a single method with try/finally block. That was before we
read books like *Clean Code*... probably because it was before they were written.[^prpr]

[^prpr]: However, *Pragmatic Programmer* (1999) was already out there. After many years of being
    aware this book exists I've decided to buy it and read it. It is beyond any recommendation and
    tip 25 *How to Balance Resources* is tackling exactly this. Personally I'd say this book is
    more essential than *Clean Code* but both should be read in any case.

Closing his chapter *Mapping to Relation Databases* Martin Fowler wrote:

{icon=quote-right}

Today there are more books related to ORM, even if you narrow it down to Java world. My attempt
tries to step away from many ORM concepts and go back to SQL roots to a degree. That does not
change the fact that Fowler's work organizing and describing all these (still applicable) patterns
is remarkable.


## Structure of the book

In the [first part](#part-jpa-good-bad) of the book we'll quickly go through JPA highs and lows
(all highly subjective, you know the disclaimer drill) with a bit of historical context as well.
This part should prepare a backdrop for any further arguments.

In the [second part](#part-opinionated-jpa) of the book we will get opinionated. After an
introduction for my case we will make a detour to meet Querydsl, because I'm not willing to
go on without it. Afterwards we'll see how to work around the features marked as questionable
(where possible).

[Third part](#part-common-problems) talks about more common problems you encounter when working
with the JPA (like paginating and N+1 select) and offers solutions for them.

Finally, [appendices](#appendices) will provide short references for related technologies I used
throughout the book (e.g. H2 database) and other additional material.


## Using code examples

Book is written on GitHub and all the code is in the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/virgo47/opinionatedjpawithquerydsl) for the book.

You may download the whole repository or browse it online, the most important snippets of code
are presented in the book. Because I present various JPA models and setups examples are split
into many small projects, each with its own Maven `pom.xml`. Entity classes and other "production"
code is in the `src/main/java` (or `resources`) while demo code is in the `src/test/java`. If you
want to run it in IDE, I recommend those that can create multiple run configurations and are able
to run normal classes (with `main`) from test sources as well -- I suspect some prominent IDEs
don't support this. But you can always run the demo code using Maven like this (from the project
directory, e.g. `examples/querydsl-basic`:

~~~
mvn test-compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="tests.DogQueryDemo"
~~~

There is also neat way how to download subtree of a GitHub project using -- surprisingly -- SVN
export. This makes running any example on the command line a breeze:

~~~
svn export https://github.com/virgo47/opinionatedjpawithquerydsl/trunk/examples/querydsl-basic
cd querydsl-basic
mvn test-compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="tests.DogQueryDemo"
~~~

Example classes mentioned in the book also link directly to the sources on GitHub (unless you
print the e-book, of course).


## My writing background

I've written more than a few posts on [my blog](http://virgo47.wordpress.com/),
mostly on technical topics, couple of them about JPA. Actually, this book is partially based on
these frustrated experiences. I always felt like a writer -- originally just to share, although not
everything is worth sharing, I know. Later I realized that writing helps me to clarify a lot of
concepts to myself. For the same reasons (sharing and learning) I gave courses and talks. Preparing
those is also kind of writing. So I hope both me and this book are not lost causes.


## Feedback

When you work on a technical book, especially alone, it happens that some of the information is not
exactly right and some might be plain wrong. Obviously, it is not my intention -- on the contrary,
I try hard to avoid any confusion or leading anyone into a mistake. However, it may happen because
the topic is not trivial. I study books and online resources, I test my solutions, I try to
understand what is going on, but sometimes I may just understand something wrong. Sorry for that
and please, if you know better, let me know. You can:

* either add an issue on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/virgo47/opinionatedjpawithquerydsl)
for the book,
* or just [email me](mailto:virgo47@gmail.com) directly.

Obviously, factual errors are probably most crucial, but other suggestions are welcome too.
